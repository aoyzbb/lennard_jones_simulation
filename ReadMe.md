### Lennard_Jones potential system Simulation
#### Introduction
This is the final term simulation work for UCAS.
`LJ_MD_New` Class for simulating Lennard Jones system(LJ) with Monte Carlo Method(MC).
`LJ_MD` Class for simulating LJ with molecular dynamics method(MD)
`Result_plot` and `result` contains example functions to plot potential energy, radical distribution etc.
